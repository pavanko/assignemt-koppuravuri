# Algebra
In number theory, two integers a and b are coprime, relatively prime or mutually prime if the only positive integer that is a divisor of both of them is 1.[1] Consequently, any prime number that divides one of a or b does not divide the other. This is equivalent to their greatest common divisor (gcd) being 1.[2] One says also a is prime to b or a is coprime with b.

The numerator and denominator of a reduced fraction are coprime. The numbers 14 and 25 are coprime, since 1 is their only common divisor. On the other hand, 14 and 21 are not coprime, because they are both divisible by 7.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers)

```
bool isPrime(int x) {
    for (int d = 2; d * d <= x; d++) {
        if (x % d == 0)
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}

```
